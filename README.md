# 2DBasicPlatformGame

This game is developed on the Unity engine, The game is about an astronaut jumping from one platform to another while some
enemies are chasing him, he has a gun that with right click you can kill these enemies , we are using basic 2D collision with the
2DPhysics of Unity and also we are using the PathFindingProject for IA. The last in particular needs to be updated in order to the
the game to work.

## Getting Started With The Game

The game is running on the Unity engine, as we know each game developed on Unity needs to be updated depending of the
Unity version it has been created, so, when we developed  this game on version 4.6.X of unity, we know it's an old version of Unity
so we decide to upgraded the version to 2017.1.X, so in order to run the game you need the 2017.1.X


### Installing

You need the Unity 2017.1.X version in order to run the game and not get any errors, here's the link:

https://unity3d.com/es/get-unity/download/archive

After you've downloaded the archive, open the folder (Project) from unity, then if you see an error on any script is just because of
the sintax, there are new methods for the code you had, so, at this point they're easy to fix but if you have any problem please
contact sergiman94@gmail.com


## Running the tests

For this branch the game is only for testing porpuses, so, the point of the code is to understand the functions of the inspector's
scripts, things like how much pain it cost for the enemy when the astronout triggers the weapon or how much life does the
astronaut has at the begginng of the game, how many lives doeas the user has,
